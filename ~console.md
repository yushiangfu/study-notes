## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

Console is the interface that users interact with systems through. 
In the old days, computers were expensive and many users shared one and accessed it by terminals, 
which were composed of small screens and teletypewriters (TTY). 
Nowadays it has become legacy but we can still see it on common OS. 
There are also pseudo TTYs shown when people access consoles in GUI desktop, or operate remote machines by SSH. 
On embedded systems, it's common that developers type commands through serial port interface (UART).
The following notes are based on OpenBMC@QEMU and Raspberry Pi 4.

## <a name="tty-types"></a> TTY Types
Device Name       | Description
--                | --
tty1 ~ n          | Command line interface. On Raspberry Pi, Ctrl + Alt + F1 ~ F6 can switch to corresponding TTY 
ptmx & pts/0 ~ n  | Pseudo TTY, responsible for GUI and SSH consoles
ttyS0 ~ n         | It means serial console and each represents one UART within chip
ttyAMA0 ~ n       | ARM serial console?
ttyUSB0 ~ n       | Serial cable with USB interface. E.g. Plug in the USB-to-TTL cable to Raspberry Pi and you can see one
ttyprintk         | Redirect message to this file and then it can be displayed by command 'dmesg'
tty               | Conceptually it's like a link that always points to the TTY device of current task
console           | In terms of results, it represents the one specified by the kernel boot argument 'console=', which is ttyS4 in my case

## <a name="tty-uart"></a> TTY <-> UART

By default, each user space task has the first three file descriptors used for stdin/stdout/stderr. Issue below command to inspect which TTY devices are used.
```
ls -l /proc/$$/fd
```

```
In serial console:
root@romulus:~# ls -l /proc/$$/fd
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Jul 27 15:25 0 -> /dev/ttyS4
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Jul 27 15:25 1 -> /dev/ttyS4
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Jul 27 15:25 2 -> /dev/ttyS4
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Jul 27 15:25 255 -> /dev/ttyS4

In SSH console:
root@romulus:~# ls -l /proc/$$/fd
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Jul 27 15:26 0 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Jul 27 15:26 1 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Jul 27 15:26 2 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------    1 root     root            64 Jul 27 15:26 255 -> /dev/pts/0
```

Below are the flowcharts showing how data is output to or input from users.

## <a name="boot-flow"></a> Boot Flow
Here we list a few functions that are related to our topic and we'll introduce them one by one.
```
init calls
  └─ of_platform_default_populate_ini()
  └─ chr_dev_init()
       └─ tty_init()
  └─ of_platform_serial_driver_init()
```

- of_platform_default_populate_init

  In this function, it adds lots of devices specified in DTS, which contains UART1 (serial0) and UART5 (serial4).
  Later they are initialized and correspond to ttyS0 and ttyS4 separately.
  
  ```
  of_platform_default_populate_init()
    └─ add device ooo
    └─ add device 1e783000.serial <-- serial0 in DTS
    └─ add device 1e784000.serial <-- serial4 in DTS
    └─ add device xxx
  ```

- tty_init

  This function registers character devices for /dev/tty, /dev/console, and /dev/tty0~63 one after another.
  Noet that /dev/tty0 is handled differently from other /dev/tty#.
  However we won't look into any of them since they are not in the root file system of OpenBMC.
  
  ```
  tty_init()
    └─ register character device for /dev/tty
    └─ register character device for /dev/console
  ```
  
- of_platform_serial_driver_init

  It registers driver 'of_serial' and probes device '1e783000.serial' & '1e784000.serial' sequentially. Here we have to introduce the 'port' concept of uart.
  Take AST2500 for example, it might be equipped with up to 5 regular UARTs (leave virtual UART alone).
  Each UART component is regarded as 'port' in the code, e.g. ttyS4 is the port 5 of UART.
  Back to the probe, it registers the UART port to the framework for each of the matched devices.

  ```
  of_platform_serial_driver_init()
    └─ register driver 'of_serial'
         └─ probe device 1e783000.serial
              └─ set up the UART port and register it
              └─ register console but fail (it's not our preferred console, which is set by kernel boot command)
         └─ probe device 1e784000.serial
              └─ set up the UART port and register it              
              └─ register console and pass (preferred console)
  ```
  
  Registered consoles are for kernel space to print out messages.
  
## <a name="mechanism-of-printk"></a> Mechanism of printk()

Unlike user space processes have TTY device to direct input/output/error, kernel threads output messages by printk and below flowchart shows how it works.

```mermaid
graph TD
   a(printk)
   b(vprintk_func)
   c(vsnprintf)
   d(log_output)
   e(console_unlock)
   
   a-->b
   b-->c 
   c-->d
   d-->e
```

- printk(), aggregate arguments
- vprintk_func(), deal with different contexts, e.g. NMI, safe, ...
- vsnprintf(), replace specifiers with real data
- log_output(), commit string to the circular buffer of printk as 'record'
- console_unlock(), for each valid record, add prefix and write to each console

```
console_unlock()
  └─ record_print_text(), insert timestamp to the beginning of string
  └─ call_console_drivers(), write out the committed record to each registered console
```

So, before registering any console, printk() can still work since it just commits the message into the ring buffer.
Once there's an available console, all pending records are handled sequentially.

## <a name="kernel-boot-arguments"></a> Kernel Boot Arguments

### earlycon

In my runtime environment the kernel boot argument is specified in DTS, and let's introduce 'earlycon' and 'console=ttyS4,115200' in order.
Function _param_setup_earlycon_ handles both 'earlycon' and 'console=', but we only focus on 'earlycon' here since the other one fails to find the matched entry.

```
param_setup_earlycon()
  └─ if it's the case of 'earlycon'
       └─ early_init_dt_scan_chosen_stdout()
            └─ find target node in DTB
            └─ traverse __earlycon_table and register early console if the matched one is found
  └─ else (case of 'console=')
       └─ (ignore)
```
So, based on the 'stdout-path' property, _early_init_dt_scan_chosen_stdout_ locates target node and knows it's 'compatible' property.
```
 chosen {
     stdout-path = "/ahb/apb/serial@1e784000"; <----------
     bootargs = "console=ttyS4,115200 earlycon";
 };
```
```
serial@1e784000 {
    compatible = "ns16550a"; <----------
    reg = <0x1e784000 0x20>;
    reg-shift = <0x02>;
    interrupts = <0x0a>;
    clocks = <0x02 0x0f>;
    no-loopback-test;
    status = "okay";
};
```
```
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_early.c:

EARLYCON_DECLARE(uart8250, early_serial8250_setup);
EARLYCON_DECLARE(uart, early_serial8250_setup);
OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE(ns16550, "ns16550", early_serial8250_setup);
OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE(ns16550a, "ns16550a", early_serial8250_setup); <----------
OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE(uart, "nvidia,tegra20-uart", early_serial8250_setup);
OF_EARLYCON_DECLARE(uart, "snps,dw-apb-uart", early_serial8250_setup);
```
Since the printk ring buffer is limited, the earlier we have console registered to display pending records, the lesser chance we suffer from message overwriting.

### console=ttyS4,115200
Parse the value, save to _console_cmdline_, and set preferred console which later affects the flow in _register_console_.
```
console_setup()
  └─ parse the setting into, e.g. 'ttyS', '4', '115200'
  └─ add_preferred_console(), save above info to console_cmdline, set preferred console
```

## <a name="conclusion"></a> Conclusion

User space tasks interact with TTY devices to control message direction, 
and the underlying destination can be local desktop application, remote machine, or serial port. 
Meanwhile, logs emitted by kernel space threads or services are committed to the circular buffer, 
which is further written out to each valid console if there's any.

There are still other interesting topics worth digging into, such as pseudo TTY and serial over LAN. Hope this note helps, thanks!
